When approaching these facsimiles for academic study, it may be useful to keep in mind these questions:

What role does the facsimile play in manuscript studies?  Should the facsimile be considered a part of a manuscript’s circulation and reception?
What is the difference between studying a text with an accidental error or imperfection and studying a facsimile with an intentional and mirrored error or imperfection?  Is there a difference between the two at all?
How should we approach the materiality of the physical facsimile?  Should facsimiles be considered reconstructive, reproductive, and/or representative of the texts they emulate?
To what extent can a physical facsimile be used in lieu of the original book or text?  What are the limits of using a facsimile?
